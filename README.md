- **Avoids reprocessing** files already analyzed using a file **hash**.
- **Detects** maximum reliable frequency, bitrate, sample rate, bit depth, and duration.
- **Calculates a quality rating (0 to 100%)** based on technical parameters.
- **Generates a formatted Excel file** (`audio_analysis.xlsx`) with:
  - Conditional coloring: Green for high-quality tracks, Red for low-quality.
  - Highlights errors automatically.
- **Logs** in `program.log` for easy review.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FrodoCompacto/audio-quality-checker
   cd audio-quality-checker
   ```

2. **Install the requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   If your .py files are properly associated with Python, you can simply double-click on the script file (`analyze.py`) to run it. The program will execute and prompt you to select the folder for analysis.

    For more control or if you encounter any issues, you can also run the script via the command line:
   ```bash
   python analyze.py
   ```

5. **Select your music folder** when prompted.

6. **Check the results**:
   - `audio_analysis.xlsx` will be created/updated.
   - `program.log` will list any issues encountered.

## üìÅ File Outputs

- **audio_analysis.xlsx**: Detailed report.
- **program.log**: Log file with errors and other data.
- **processed_state.json**: Internal tracking to skip already analyzed files.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- Libraries:
  - `librosa`
  - `numpy`
  - `mutagen`
  - `openpyxl`
  - `tkinter` (comes with Python standard on most systems)

## üîß FFmpeg (Optional but Recommended)

This application can run **without FFmpeg**, but using FFmpeg will help avoid errors when processing some tracks, especially for formats like **MP3** and **M4A**. FFmpeg improves compatibility and provides better audio handling.

If you want to use FFmpeg with this tool, follow the instructions below:

### Windows:
1. **Download FFmpeg**:
   - Visit [gyan.dev official website](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) and download the **ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z**.
   - Extract the archive and copy the `bin` folder to your project directory, i.e., `./ffmpeg/bin`.
    - **Example folder structure**:
```
/audio-quality-checker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_analysis.xlsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ program.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processed_state.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg.exe
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffprop.exe
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other-ffmpeg-files
```

2. **Add FFmpeg to PATH (optional)**:
   - You can also add the FFmpeg folder to your system's PATH environment variable for global usage. In this case the program will recognize ffmpeg automatically, and it will not be necessary to install the standalone version in the project root.

### Linux:
1. **Install FFmpeg**:
   - On **Ubuntu/Debian** systems:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```
   - On **Fedora** systems:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install ffmpeg
     ```
   - On **Arch Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
     ```

2. **Using FFmpeg Standalone (optional)**:
   - If you want to use a local FFmpeg build, download the static build from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   - Extract the `ffmpeg` folder to your project directory (e.g., `./ffmpeg/bin`).

Once FFmpeg is installed or included, the tool will automatically use it for better audio handling.

## üìà Rating System

The quality rating (0 to 100%) is calculated based on:
- Maximum reliable frequency detected.
- Bitrate of the file.
- Sampling rate.
- Bit depth (if available).

The rating is calculated based on technical parameters like frequency, bitrate, sample rate, and bit depth. Here's how you can interpret the results:

  - 80% or higher: The track is generally good enough for professional events and DJ performances. This rating indicates the track has a high enough quality for most shows and is suitable for high-quality sound systems.

  - 90% or higher: The track is considered excellent quality and would be perfect for events that require the best possible sound, such as large-scale concerts or professional DJ sets.

  - Below 80%: These tracks might have lower quality and may not sound as good on high-end audio systems. They might be acceptable for casual settings but are not recommended for professional performances.

Note: These are just guidelines. Audio quality can be subjective depending on the equipment used and the specific needs of the event. Use your discretion when selecting tracks for a performance.

## ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì How to Customize the Output

Inside `analyze.py`, you can configure these parameters to fit your needs:

### Configurable Parameters

```python
THRESH_DB = -60
```
- Threshold in decibels. Frequencies below this value are considered too weak to be meaningful.

```python
PROPORTION_THRESHOLD = 0.05
```
- Minimum proportion (5%) of the track that must exhibit energy at a frequency to consider it valid.

```python
N_FFT = 4096
```
- Size of the window used in the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). Larger values provide higher frequency resolution but slower processing.

```python
STATE_FILE = 'processed_state.json'
```
- Name of the file that keeps track of which tracks have already been analyzed to avoid redundant work.

```python
EXCEL_FILE = 'audio_analysis.xlsx'
```
- Name of the generated Excel file containing the analysis results.

```python
LOG_FILE = 'program.log'
```
- Name of the file where the logs generated during analysis will be recorded.

```python
WEIGHTS = {
    'freq': 40,
    'bitrate': 30,
    'samplerate': 20,
    'bitdepth': 10
}
```
- Defines how much each factor (frequency, bitrate, sample rate, bit depth) contributes to the overall quality rating.

You can adjust thresholds, file types, and how much each factor impacts the quality rating depending on your event requirements.
